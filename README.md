**Procedure:**
1. The program should print on the screen the main menu and ask the user to select an option![image](https://github.com/HidayaMustafa/Shell-Scripting-Project-Statistics-of-Running-Processes-on-Linux-Machine/assets/144602671/873c140a-bafe-4fcb-bdf2-9c49a724a107)

2. If the user enters ‘r’:

a. The program should print on the screen “Please input the name of the file”.

b. The program should verify that the file exists, otherwise a message should be printed on the screen “file does not exist” and then return to the main menu.
4. If the user enters ‘c’: the program should extract the CPU usage from the file for each time instance and then print the average, minimum, and maximum CPU usage on the screen. Also, print the main menu again.
5. If the user enters ‘i’: the program should extract the number of packets received (in) over the network for each time instance and then print the average, minimum, and maximum received packets. Also, print the main menu again.
6. If the user enters ‘o’: the program should extract the number of packets sent (out) over the network for each time instance and then print the average, minimum, and maximum sent packets. Also, print the main menu again.
7. If the user enters ‘u’:

a. The program should prompt you for an integer number m. If the entered value is not an integer, the program should print an error message.

b. The program should print m commands that have the highest maximum average CPU usage on the screen. The program should also print the average CPU usage for each of these commands on the screen. Also, print the main menu again.
8. If the user enters ‘a’:

a. The program should prompt you for an integer number m. If the entered value is not an integer, the program should print an error message.

b. The program should print m commands that have the highest average memory usage on the screen. The program should also print the average memory usage for each of these commands on the screen. Also, print the main menu again.
9. If the user enters ‘b’:

a. The program should prompt you for an integer number m. If the entered value is not an integer, the program should print an error message.

b. The program should print m commands that have the minimum average memory usage on the screen. The program should also print the average memory usage for each of these commands on the screen. Also, print the main menu again.
10. If the user enters ‘e’: the program should print on the screen “Are you sure you want to exist”. If the person inputs “yes”, the program ends. Otherwise, the program should return to the main menu.
